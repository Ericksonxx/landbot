# Landbot Implementation - React
npm start

### Stack
The app is created with React, styled with CSS. 
I've used a firebase storage app for CV uploads.

### Experience
I created an account and explored the bot creation portal, it was a very fun experience.
The library was easy too use, not much to read to get started. The response fields from the API make the work a lot easier.
